<p>You can use the '<em>sitewide</em>' context condition to make a context active on every page of your site.</p>
<p>Note that paths <em>can trump</em> the sitewide context, so if you have another context in the same namespace/attribute, with a value alphabetically 'higher' and set with path conditions, then potentially that context would be set instead of the sitewide one.</p>
